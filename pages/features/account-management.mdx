# Account management screens

The "My account" page is available from the top navigation, when clicking on the user's profile picture.
It allows users to manage their personal information and account settings.
It contains two subsections that are available thanks to a responsive tab menu:

## Profile tab

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As for the other pages, this is mapped by default to a JHipster API. The code
  corresponding to this page is in the `src/spa/account/PageProfile.tsx`
  component.
</Callout>

The profile subsection allows users to edit their first name, last name, email, and language preferences.
To access this subsection, click on the "Profile" tab within the "My account" section.
On the profile page, users can update their personal information by entering the desired values
in the respective fields and clicking the "Save" button. The fields are validated like on the register form
which is documented on the [authentication page](/features/authentication).

<ImageTabs

    alt: "Profile page on desktop",
    src: profileDesktopImage,
  }}
  mobile={{

/>

## Password tab

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As for the other pages, this is mapped by default to a JHipster API. The code
  corresponding to this page is in the `src/spa/account/PagePassword.tsx`
  component.
</Callout>

The password subsection allows users to update their account password.
To access this subsection, click on the "Password" tab within the "My account" page.

On the password page, users must enter their current password and the new password they wish to use in the appropriate fields.
They must also confirm the new password by entering it again in the "Password confirm" field.
Once all fields are filled out, click the "Save" button to update the password.
