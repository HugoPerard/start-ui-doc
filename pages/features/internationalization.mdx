Start UI already implements internationalization, which means that it is designed to support multiple languages.
It currently supports French, English, Arabic and Swahili, and is set up to display text in these languages in a way that is appropriate
for the language's writing system. For example, if you are using Start UI in Arabic, the text will be displayed right-to-left, as is standard for Arabic.
Similarly, if you are using Start UI in Swahili, the text will be displayed left-to-right, as is standard for languages that use the Latin alphabet.
This allows users to access the user interface in their preferred language, making it more accessible and user-friendly for people around the world.
The supported locales are available in [DayJS' documentation](https://day.js.org/docs/en/i18n/i18n).
The default language is English and the font size of each implemented language can be adjusted manually (see **Guides / Adding a new language**).

## Choosing language

To change your selected language, simply go to your profile's page, and select the language you want applied through the **Language** Select :

import selectLanguageDesktop from '../../public/images/screenshots/internationalization/select-language-desktop.png';
import selectLanguageMobile from '../../public/images/screenshots/internationalization/select-language-mobile.png';

<ImageTabs
    desktopImage={{
        alt: "Select language screenshot on desktop",
        src: selectLanguageDesktop,
    }}
    mobileImage={{
        alt: "Select language screenshot on mobile",
        src: selectLanguageMobile,
    }}
/>

Switching from one language that's written left-to-right to another that is not will automatically apply the expected change after clicking **Save** :

import selectArabicLanguageDesktop from '../../public/images/screenshots/internationalization/select-language-arabic-desktop.png';
import selectArabicLanguageMobile from '../../public/images/screenshots/internationalization/select-language-arabic-mobile.png';

<ImageTabs
    desktopImage={{
        alt: "Select Arabic language screenshot on desktop",
        src: selectArabicLanguageDesktop,
    }}
    mobileImage={{
        alt: "Select Arabic language screenshot on mobile",
        src: selectArabicLanguageMobile,
    }}
/>
