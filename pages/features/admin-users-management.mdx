# Admin users management

The users management page can be accessed by administrator users from the top navigation by clicking on the "Admin" top bar
item. It allows administrators to view, create and edit users.

## Listing

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

  corresponding to this page is in the `src/spa/admin/users/PageUsers.tsx`
  component.
</Callout>

The users listing displays all the users in the application. The listing contains some information
about each user as well as some actions, that can be performed by clicking on the three dots button in each row :

- **edit** : navigate to user page edition _(you can also click on user's row)_
- **activate**/**deactivate** : toggle user status
- **delete** : delete the user

  }}
  mobileImage={{

  }}
/>
